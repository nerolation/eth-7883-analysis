## Technical Implementation Details

### EIP-7883 Changes

EIP-7883 modifies the ModExp gas calculation in three key ways:

1. **Multiplication Complexity**: 
   - For inputs ≤32 bytes: Fixed cost of 16 (vs variable in EIP-2565)
   - For inputs >32 bytes: 2 × words² (vs more complex formula in EIP-2565)

2. **Iteration Count Multiplier**: 
   - Changed from 8× to 16× for large exponents (>32 bytes)

3. **Minimum Gas Cost**: 
   - Increased from 200 to 500 gas

### Impact Breakdown by Input Size

The cost increases are primarily driven by the minimum gas increase (200→500) for small operations and the iteration count multiplier change for large exponents.


## Analysis Methodology

### Data Scope
- **Block range**: N/A
- **Total calls analyzed**: 304,301
- **Data source**: Ethereum mainnet ModExp precompile calls
- **Analysis date**: 2025-06-29

### Calculation Methods
- Gas costs calculated using both current EIP-2565 and proposed EIP-7883 formulas
- All increases represent the additional gas that would be required under EIP-7883
- Percentile analysis excludes calls with no cost increase (where EIP-7883 cost equals current cost)


## Conclusions and Implications

### Network Impact Assessment

1. **Limited Scope**: Only 38.5% of ModExp calls experience cost increases, indicating EIP-7883's targeted approach.

2. **Predictable Costs**: The cost increases follow predictable patterns based on input sizes, allowing users to estimate impacts.

3. **Security Enhancement**: The minimum cost increase (200→500 gas) provides better protection against potential DoS attacks while having minimal impact on legitimate usage.

4. **Large Operation Impact**: Operations with large exponents see the most significant cost increases due to the iteration multiplier change (8×→16×).

### Recommendations

#### For Dapp Developers
- Review any ModExp usage in your contracts, particularly operations with large exponents
- Budget for potential 2.5× cost increases for operations currently at the 200 gas minimum
- Consider optimizing exponent sizes where possible

#### For Infrastructure Providers  
- Update gas estimation tools to account for EIP-7883 changes
- Monitor ModExp usage patterns to validate impact estimates post-implementation

#### for the Ethereum Community
- The analysis supports EIP-7883's goal of fixing underpriced edge cases while maintaining reasonable costs for common usage patterns
- The targeted nature of the changes minimizes ecosystem disruption while improving security

### Data Quality Notes

This analysis is based on historical mainnet data and provides empirical evidence of EIP-7883's impact. The relatively small sample size (304301 calls) reflects the specialized nature of the ModExp precompile, which is primarily used by cryptographic applications and zero-knowledge proof systems.
