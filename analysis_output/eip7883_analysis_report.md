## Conclusions

1. **Limited Impact**: Only 38.5% of ModExp calls see cost increases under EIP-7883.

2. **Targeted Changes**: The increases primarily affect calls with large inputs (>32 bytes), which aligns with EIP-7883's goal of addressing underpriced edge cases.

3. **Security Improvement**: The minimum cost increase from 200 to 500 gas provides better protection against potential DoS attacks using small inputs.

4. **Predictable Impact**: The cost increases follow a predictable pattern based on input sizes, allowing users to estimate impacts.

## Recommendations

1. **Contract Operators**: Review ModExp usage patterns and budget for potential gas increases, particularly for operations with large exponents.

2. **Network Monitoring**: Continue monitoring ModExp usage patterns post-implementation to validate impact estimates.

3. **Documentation**: Update documentation and tools to reflect new gas calculations for developer awareness.
